# Overflow Property

- `overflow` sets the behavior when the content of an element overflows its padding

- `visible` (default) lets the content overflow

- `hidden` will hide all the overflowing content but it will still exist

- `clip` will remove the overflowing content

- `scroll` will add a scrollbar to the container and eliminate overflow

- `auto` will let the browser decide what to do with the overflow

- `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` can be used to change how overflow is dealt with
in x and y directions separately
