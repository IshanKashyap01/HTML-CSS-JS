# Introduction to JavaScript Syntax

```js
console.log("hello world");
console.log(1 + 2);
```

- String values in JS must be surrounded by backticks, single or double quotes
while numerical expressions are written as is

- JS has **ASI** (Automatic Semicolon Insertion), making semicolons optional

- However, the ASI is not perfect and may cause errors in some cases

- Therefore, add semicolons when writing more than one statement in a line or
statements spanning more than one line
