# Application Programming Interfaces

- An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different softwares to
communicate with each other

- It provides functions, procedures and definitions that developers can use to
interact with a software component, library or service

- In JS, we broadly deal with two types of APIs:

    1. **Browser API**: the built-in API provided by the browser

        - For ex. `console`, `alert`, `prompt`, and `confirm` are all functions
        of the `window` global object of the browser

    2. **Third-party APIs**

- The communication could be be one-way or two-way depending on the APIs
