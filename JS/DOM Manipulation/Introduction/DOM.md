# Document Object Model

- DOM is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML based markup
language document

- It represents the structure of a document in memory as a *logical tree* called
a *node or a DOM tree*

## Node/DOM Tree

- Each branch of the tree ends in a *node* and each node contains *objects*

- In other words, each node represents a part of the document such as an
*element, string or comment*

- Nodes can be *created, moved or changed* and *event listeners* can be added to
them

## Uses of DOM

- It is one of the *most used APIs on the web* as it connects *web-pages to*
*scripts*

- DOM is an object-oriented representation of a webpage and allows it to be
modified with a scripting language like JS

- In other words, it allows us to change the *structure, style or content* of
a webpage
