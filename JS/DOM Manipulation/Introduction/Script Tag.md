# Script Tag

- We know that the `script` tag links a JavaScript source to the webpage

- However, it can be added either in the `body` or the `head` section

- Generally, if a JS file manipulates the DOM, we add it as the last element of
the `body` tag

- If the source file refers to an external library, we use it in the `head` tag
