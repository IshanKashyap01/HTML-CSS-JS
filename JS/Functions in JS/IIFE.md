# Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

```js
(/* function expression here */)();
```

- IIFEs are function expressions that are invoked as soon as they're created

- Therefore, IIFEs cannot be saved for later use even if they're returned from
a function

- Any variable declared within an IIFE is inaccessible outside it
