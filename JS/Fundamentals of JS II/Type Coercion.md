# Type Coercion

- It is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one type to another

- For example, adding a number and a string will convert the number to a string

  - `console.log('5' + 5)` will print the string `55`

- While any other operator like minus, multiply or divide, will convert the string
to a number

- Basically, JS does the conversion that makes the most sense based on the operator
used
