# JavaScript Runtime Environment

- It is the environment responsible for running JavaScript on a platform

- Using the JSRE, we can run JS code anywhere like browsers, phones, backend, etc.

- It consists of the following components:

    1. JavaScript Engine

    2. Web API

    3. Callback Queue

    4. Event loop

## JS Engine

- JS is run by the *JavaScript Engine* of the browser; different browsers uses
different engines

- For example, *Chrome* uses the *V8* engine, while *Firefox* uses the *SpiderMonkey*
engine

- The JS engine contains the call stack and the heap and is responsible for
memory management and garbage collection

## Web API

It allows JS to interact with web elements like consoles, alert, confirm and
prompt dialog boxes, etc.
