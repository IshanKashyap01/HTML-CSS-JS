# Execution Context in JavaScript

- **Execution Context** is the environment where the JS code of the HTML file
is evaluated and executed

- When multiple JS files are added in an HTML file, they're all executed in the
*same execution context*

- The JS engine is responsible for creating and managing the *execution context*

- It is divided into *two components*:

    1. **Variable Environment** (*memory* component)

    2. **Thread of Execution** (*code* component)

- Execution context goes through *three phases*: *creation*, *execution* and
*cleanup*
