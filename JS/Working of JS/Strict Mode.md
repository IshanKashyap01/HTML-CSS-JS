# Strict Mode

```js
'use strict'
// Your code as usual
```

- It is a feature of JS that runs the code with stricter rules and throws errors
that would otherwise be ignored

- It is recommended for writing reliable and maintainable code, especially in
large or collaborative projects

- For example, initializing values to undeclared variables will throw a
`ReferenceError`
