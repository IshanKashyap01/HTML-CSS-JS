# Break vs Continue

- `break` is used to pause and exit without finishing the remaining statements

- It will work even if it is present in an `if` statement nested within a loop

- Whereas, `continue` only skips the current iteration of loops

- While `continue` can only be used in loops, `break` can be used in loops as
well as the `switch` statement
