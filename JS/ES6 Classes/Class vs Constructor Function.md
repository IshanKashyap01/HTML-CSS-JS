# Classes vs Constructor Functions

- Functions defined in a class goes in the prototype instead of being part of
the object itself

- In constructor functions, we have to manually assign the prototype and properties
for inheritance

  - Meanwhile, this happens automatically in classes by using the `extends`
  keyword
