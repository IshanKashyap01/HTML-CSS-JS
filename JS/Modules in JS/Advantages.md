# Advantages of ES6 Modules

- ES6 modules allows you to break your code into multiple files without this
hassle

- They allow exporting and importing selected elements b/w files

- While the elements that are not exported are private to their own files

- This reduces the size of the global scope by adding the *module* scope

- Therefore, making code more readable and maintainable

- The best way to use them is to break the code logically and import it into a
main file

- This way, only the main file gets added to the HTML page
