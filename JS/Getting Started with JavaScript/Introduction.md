# Introduction to JavaScript

- JS is a *high-level, lightweight, dynamic and, multi-paradigm* programming
language

- While HTML gives *structure* and CSS provides *presentation*, JS adds *behavior*
to your webpage

- It can be used for the following:

  - creating animations and user interactions,

  - image/video previews and dynamic content scrolling

  - auto-complete suggestions, infinite scroll, and real-time updates

- The following JS libraries enhances the usability of JS much further:

    1. **Front-end**: `ReactJS`, `AngularJS` and `VueJS`

    2. **Back-end**/Server-side: `Node-JS`

    3. **Mobile Development**: `React Native`

## How to Add JS in HTML

```HTML
<script src="myApp.js"></script>
```

You can directly write JS code within the `script` element or link a file using
its `src` attribute
