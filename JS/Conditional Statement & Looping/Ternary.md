# Ternary Operator

```js
const isAdult = age >= 18 ? true : false;
```

- The ternary operator (`?:`) is the only operator in JS that accepts three
operands:

    1. Before `?`: a conditional

    2. After `?`: resultant value if the condition is true

    3. After `:`: resultant value if the condition is false

- It is best used as an alternative to a simple `if-else` statement
