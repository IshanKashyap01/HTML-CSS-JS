# Introduction to Semantics in HTML

- HTML tags can be categorized into the following:

    1. Visual/representational

    2. Semantic

    3. Structural

- However, HTML elements can also be a combination of any of these

- *Visual tags* are HTML elements that affect the presentation of a webpage

- For example: `b`, `i`, `u`, `button`, `input` etc.

- *Structural tags* are those elements that affect the structure of a webpage

- For example: `p`, `div`, `span` etc.

- *Semantic tags* are those elements that have a clear meaning to *both humans*
*and machines*

- For ex. `em`, `strong`, `header`, `main`, `nav`, `footer`, `form` etc.
