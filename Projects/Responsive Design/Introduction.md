# Introduction to Responsive Design

- Webpages should render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring
usability

- There are three ways to achieve this:

    1. **Responsive Web Design**: Uses CSS rules to adapt the design and layout
    based on the screen size

    2. **Dynamic Serving**: Server sends different front-end files (HTML, CSS, JS)
    by checking the client's device size beforehand

    3. Separate URLs for mobile & desktop

- Both separate URLs and dynamic serving are more expensive and time consuming

- While dynamic serving can also sometimes break the content on some devices

- Whereas responsive design is more consistent and less expensive than both

- However, neither of the three are mutually exclusive

- Responsive design utilises relative units and various layouts such as `flex`,
`grid` and *media queries*
