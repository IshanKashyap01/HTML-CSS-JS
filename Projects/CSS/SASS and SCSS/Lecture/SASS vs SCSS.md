- Consequently, to implement these features, it uses its own *stylesheet language*

- The *SASS preprocessor* accepts two stylesheet languages: `SASS` and `SCSS`

## Difference Between SASS and SCSS

- As `SCSS` is a superset of CSS, it only adds new functionalities while keeping
all the original syntax of CSS

- Therefore, `SCSS` can also import plain `CSS` files as well as its own

*semicolons* and makes *colons* optional

- Subsequently, `SASS` files cannot import plain `CSS` or `SCSS` files
