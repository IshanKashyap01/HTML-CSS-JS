# Radio Buttons

```HTML
<input type = "radio" id = "yes" name = "onBoard" value = "yes">
<label>Yes</label>
<input type = "radio" id = "no" name = "onBoard" value = "no" checked>
<label>No</label>
```

- Radio buttons can be grouped together by giving them the same name

- By making one option `checked` we can ensure that this value is included when
the form is submitted
