# Introduction to Forms

```HTML
<form>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Set 1</legend>
        <label for="un">Username</label>
        <input type="text">
        <input type="submit">
    </fieldset>
</form>
```

- `<form>` tag is used to create a form in an HTML document

- `<fieldset>` divides a form into various sections

- `<legend>` tag is used inside a `fieldset` to add a heading to it

- `<label>` tag creates a text label for an input element like a text or password
field

  - `for` attribute can be used to associate a label with an input element

  - This way, if a user clicks on the label, the focus is directed to the input field

- `<input>` tag is used to accept different types of input from the user
