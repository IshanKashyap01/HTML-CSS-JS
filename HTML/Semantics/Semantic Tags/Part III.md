```HTML
<figure>
    <img src="image.jpg" title="image" alt="image">
    <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- `<figure>` contains self-contained images, diagrams, photos, etc.

- Content of `figure` is related to the main flow but it can be positioned
anywhere in the document

`<figcaption>` provides a caption to the figure element and is always inside it
