# Introduction to Semantic Tags

- Semantic tags are HTML elements that clearly define their meaning in both a
*human* and *machine*-readable way

- That is, they convey their purpose to *developers, browsers and search engines*

- They help screen readers by providing context, browsers in consistently loading
the webpage and search engines for SEO (search engine optimization)

- `em` and `strong` are *both visual and semantic* as they provide semantic
meaning as well as does what `i` and `b` do

- Similarly, the `form` tag is *both, a structural and a semantic* tag
