# Introduction to HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

- Hyper text refers to the *links* on a webpage that connects it to other text
over the internet

- Markup Language refers to the *structure* and the *content* on the page using
a set of *tags* and *attributes*

- `Tags` are predefined components of HTML that are always enclosed with angle
brackets (< and >)

- Most tags have *attributes* that define or modify their behaviour based on their
values

- HTML is a **case-insensitive** language but we use the same case to maintain
consistency

## Evolution of HTML

1. **HTML 1.0** was released in 1991 with enough syntax to create a basic webpage

2. **HTML 2.0** was released in 1993 and introduced *forms and tables*

    Meanwhile, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was formed in 1995 to standardize
    web development

3. **HTML 3.2** was released in 1997 by W3C with *frames, style sheets and applets*

4. **HTML 4.0** was released in 1999 introducing *namespaces, DOM and CSS*

    XHTML 1.0 was the reformulation of HTML as an `XML` application in 2000
    to make it stricter but didn't work out

5. **HTML 5.0** is the current version released in 2014 that introduced *A/V,*
*Canvas, SVG, and semantic tags*
