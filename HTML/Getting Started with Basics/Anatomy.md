# Anatomy of an HTML Document

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This is a comment -->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Title of the HTML document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        This is the section that gets displayed on the browser
    </body>
</html>
```

- Here, `<!DOCTYPE html>` denotes that the document is written in HTML 5

- `<html>` is the root tag of HTML which contains all the content

- `<head>` contains the metadata of the document (won't be displayed) like title
or character set

- `<body>` contains all the actual data and structure of the webpage that will
be displayed by the browser
