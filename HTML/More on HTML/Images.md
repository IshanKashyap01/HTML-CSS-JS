# Image Tag

```HTML
<img
src = "https://imagelink.com/image.jpg"
width = "80%"
height = "200"
title = "Image title"
alt = "alternate text">
```

- `<img>` tag is used to display images on the webpages

- `src` takes the location of the image; it could be a link or a local file

- `width` and `height` attributes can be given in *pixels* (default) or percentage

- For pixels, you can either just write the number or suffix `px` to it

- For percentage, you need to suffix the `%` sign; it tells what percent of the
screen should the image's dimension cover

- `title` is the hover text that will be displayed if your cursor is over the
image

- `alt` is the text that will be displayed instead of the image if it couldn't
be loaded/shown
