# Video Tag

```HTML
<video 
    src="multimedia/video.mp4" width = "600" height = "300" 
    controls autoplay muted
>
    Video not supported
</video>
```

- `<video>` tag is used to display videos on a webpage

- If the video is not played by the browser, the content b/w the opening and
closing tag will be displayed

- `src`, `width`, and `height` tag works the same as they do with the `<image>`
tag

- `controls` will add *play/pause, full-screen, mute and options* buttons to
the video

- `autoplay` will automatically start the video as soon the webpage is loaded

- `muted` means the video will be muted by default
