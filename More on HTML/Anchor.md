# Anchor Tag

```HTML
<a href="link_to_source.html" target="_blank">
    next
</a>
```

- `<a>` (anchor) tag is used to create hyperlinks

- `href` attribute stands for *hypertext reference* and accepts the link of the
destination

- `target` specifies where the linked document is opened; `_blank` value means
the document will open in a new tab

```HTML
<a href="#act">Activities</a>
.
.
.
<h2 id="act">Activities</h2>
```

- To link an element within the webpage, the `id` of the element is entered in
the `href` attribute prefixed with a `#`

- `id` attribute is a **global attribute** that specifies the unique identity of
an element
