# Absolute and Relative Paths

- Absolute path is the *complete* location of the file i.e. from the *root* of
the system. For ex. `D:/folder1/image.jpg`

- Relative path is the location of the file wrt to the folder of the document
its referenced in

- Suppose if the HTML document is in `D:/folder1/` and the file is in `D:/folder1/folder2`

- The relative path of the file wrt the HTML document will be `folder2/image.jpg`

- Similarly, if the document was in `folder2` and file was in `folder1`, the
relative path would be `../image.jpg`
