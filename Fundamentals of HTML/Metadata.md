# Getting Started with HTML Metadata

```HTML
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

- `<meta>` defines the metadata of the HTML document

- `charset` defines the character encoding to be used

- `name="viewport"` means the tag is defining the page's dimensions and scaling
on different devices

- `content` provides the key-pair values for specific settings corresponding to
the value in the `name` tag

- `width=device-width` tells the browser to set the width of the page to that of
the device

- `initial-scale=1.0` sets the zoom level of the page when it first loads to the
actual size (no zoom)
