# Entity Characters

- Reserved characters cannot be directly used but have a corresponding code that
starts with `&` and ends with `;`

- These characters have entities with both names and numbers

- For ex. `<` can be written as both `&lt;` and `&#60`

- Similarly, for more than one space, we need to use `&nbsp;` multiple times
which is used for *non-breaking space*
