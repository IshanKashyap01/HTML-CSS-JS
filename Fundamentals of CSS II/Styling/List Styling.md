# List Styling

## List Style Type

- `list-style-type` sets the `type` attribute of lists, however, unlike HTML,
it has a long list to choose from

- It works for both `ul` and `ol` with various values for both

## List Style Position

- `list-style-position` sets the relative position of the list

- `outside` (default) adds a tab space in front of the list while `inside`
doesn't

## List Style Image

`list-style-image` sets an image as the bullet for *unordered lists*

## List Style

`list-style` is a shorthand that sets the *type, position and image* properties
for the list
