# Flex & Flex Flow

## Flex

```CSS
/* Three values */
flex: <flex-grow> && <flex-shrink> && <flex-basis> 
/* Two values */
flex: <flex-grow> && <flex-shrink> | <flex-basis>
/* One value */
flex: <flex-grow> | <flex-basis>
```

- `flex` is a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`

- It is recommended that this shorthand be used instead of giving these three values
separately

## Flex Flow

```CSS
flex-flow: <flex-direction> && <flex-wrap>
```

`flex-flow` is a shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`
