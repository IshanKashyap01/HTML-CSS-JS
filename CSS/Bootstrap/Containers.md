# Containers in Bootstrap

- Bootstrap containers are a fundamental building block that contain, pad and
align your content

- Containers have the following six breakpoints: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`,
and `xxl`

- These breakpoints serve as an alternative to media queries for responsive
or fluid design

- For ex. suppose, we have a container element with class `container-md`

- At smaller breakpoints i.e. `xs` and `sm`, the container will be fluid

- While at larger breakpoints, the container will be responsive

- Responsive containers will not take the full width of the container and have
a `max-width`

- Whereas, fluid containers will occupy 100% of the viewport width;

- `container-fluid` class can be used for making a container fluid
