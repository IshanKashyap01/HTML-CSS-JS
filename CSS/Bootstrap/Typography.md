# Typography

## Headings

- Headings in bootstrap have no top or side margins, and a `0.5rem` bottom margin

- Classes `h1` through `h6` can be used when you want to match the styling of
a heading without the semantics

- Bootstrap also contains *display* headings that are slightly larger in size,
without the *bold* effect

- These can be accessed by adding the classes `display-1` through `display-6`

## Paragraphs

- You can make a paragraph stand out by adding the class `lead` to it

- The class `small` has the same styling as the `<small>` tag

## Text

### Text Styling

- Classes `text-start` `text-center` and `text-end` can be used for left, center
and right text alignment respectively

- For font sizes, classes `fs-1` through `fs-6` can be used

- `fw-bold`, `fw-bolder`, `fw-light`, `fw-medium`, etc. classes applies font weight

- `fst-italic` class applies italics styling to the text
