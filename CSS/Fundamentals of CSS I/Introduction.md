# Introduction to CSS

- CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets* and provides styling to HTML pages

- We can centralize key styling themes for the entire website as well as define
specifics for individual pages

- The basic syntax of a CSS script is as follows:

```CSS
Selector /* comment */
{
    property:value;
    ...
    property:value;
}
```
