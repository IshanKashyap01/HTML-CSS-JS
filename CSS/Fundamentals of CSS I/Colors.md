# Using Colors in CSS

- Although there are over 140 named colors in CSS, there are other ways as well

- One of them is using the *hexadecimal code* for the color, which is a *6 digit*
*hexadecimal value* prefixed with a `#`

- Alternatively, we can use the `RGB()` function as:
$RGB(R, G, B)\text{ where } R,G,B\ \epsilon\ [0, 255]$

- Similarly, `RBGA()` can also be used where A ($\alpha$) stands for transparency

- An $\alpha$ value of $0$ means transparent and $1$ means opaque

- `HSL` or `HSLA` is another alternative which stands for *Hue, Saturation and*
*Lightness*
