# CSS Units

- In CSS, units can be either *absolute* (pixels, cm, etc), or *relative* (percent,
vw, vh, etc.)

- The **default font-size** used in HTML is `16px`

## Absolute Units

- Absolute units include `px`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, `Q`, `pc` and `pt`

- *A pixel* is equivalent to $1/96^{th}$ of an inch instead of *one pixel* on
any given screen

## Relative Units

- `vw` or *viewport width* and `vh` or *viewport height* are relative to the
actual screen size in %

- While `em` is relative to the *parent element*, `rem` is relative to the *root*
*element*

- Percentages are relative to the element's parent container
