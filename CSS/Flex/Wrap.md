# Flex Wrap

```CSS
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
```

Sets whether the elements will be forced onto one line or distributed b/w multiple
lines

- `nowrap` (default) forces all elements in the same line by reducing their dimensions

- `wrap` lets the elements retain their original dimensions and places extra elements
to the next line

- `wrap-reverse` reverses the start and end of the *cross axis*

## Row & Column Gap

```CSS
row-gap: <length>
column-gap: <length>
```

`row-gap` sets the space b/w rows while `column-gap` sets the space b/w columns
