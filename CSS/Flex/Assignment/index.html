                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learnt were
                current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
                like I got every penny's worth!!<br>
                <q>
                    I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
                    been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
                    who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                    intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                    thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and the most
                    grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                    successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                    at a VR startup.

                    I now work as a mobile engineer for a big tech company. This
                    was one of the best investments I made in myself.

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
                Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences
                was easy!!<br>
                <q>
                    The staff seemed genuinely concerned about my progress which
                    I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence
                    necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
                    as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
                    You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
                    community of smart and amazing people.

                Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended!!<br>
                <q>
                    Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
                    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                    me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                    by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program. The entire curriculum and the staff did
                    not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                    wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                    was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level

                The team was very supportive and collaborative!!<br>
                <q>
                    Completing my studies was an enriching experience that
                    exceeded my expectations. The faculty's dedication to excellence
                    and their commitment to student success fostered an environment
                    where I could thrive academically and personally. The curriculum
                    was rigorous yet engaging, providing me with the knowledge
                    and skills necessary to excel in my chosen field. Additionally,
                    the university's emphasis on practical application through
                    internships and research opportunities allowed me to gain
                    valuable real-world experience. I am proud to be a part of
                    Coding Ninjas, and I am confident that the education I received
                    has prepared me well for future endeavours.
