# Animation

`animation` applies animation b/w styles and is the shorthand for the following:

1. `animation-name`

2. `animation-duration`

3. `animation-delay`

4. `animation-timing-function`

5. `animation-iteration-count`

6. `animation-direction`

7. `animation-fill-mode`

8. `animation-play-state`

*Note:* `animation-duration`, `animation-delay` and `animation-timing-function` works
the similar to their `transition` counterparts
