# Gradient

- A gradient is a progressive transition b/w two or more colors

- It can be used as an alternative to images

- As it is dynamically generated, it looks better when zoomed and can be resized
however you want

- There are three types of gradients you can choose from:

    1. **Linear** Gradient

    2. **Radial** Gradient

    3. **Conic** Gradient

- *Linear* gradient progresses in a straight line

- *Radial* gradient progresses in a *circular* or *elliptical* fashion

- *Conic* gradient rotates around a center point
