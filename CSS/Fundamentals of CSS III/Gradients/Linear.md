# Linear Gradient

```CSS
body
{
    background: linear-gradient(direction, color1, color2 x%, ...);
}
```

- We can also specify the relative space covered by the colors

- The default is from top to bottom however, `to right`, `to left`, `to top right`,
`to bottom left`, etc. can be specified

- Alternately, we can also specify the direction as degrees such as `120deg`,
`75deg`, etc.
