# Link Styling

```CSS
a
{
    outline: 1px solid aquamarine;
    cursor: none;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

- `outline` is the same as `border` except it doesn't take extra space

- `cursor` changes how the cursor looks when it is hovering above an element

- Setting `text-decoration` to `none` will remove the *underline* from the link
