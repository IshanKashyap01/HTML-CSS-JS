# Display Properties

## Display

```CSS
display: inline | block | inline-block ;
```

The `display` property specifies whether an element will be treated as a *block*
or *inline* element

### Inline

- `inline` makes an element take just enough space that it fits the content within

- `height` and `width` are fixed for `inline` elements with the exception of the
`img` tag

### Block

- `block` makes an element conserve the entire width of the viewport whether it's
using it or not

- Therefore, forcing the next elements to the next line

### Inline-Block

`inline-block` makes the element inline but also allows variable dimensions

## Vertical Alignment

- `vertical-align` sets the vertical alignment for an `inline`, `inline-block`
or a *table cell box*

- The default value is `bottom`
