# Border Properties

## Border Width

`border-width` sets the width of an elements border using one to four values:

## Border Color

`border-color` sets the color for the border of the element

## Border Style

- `border-style` sets the line style property for all sides of an element's border

- It can take one of the following values:

  - `dotted` series of rounded dots of radius half the size of `border-width`

  - `dashed` series of square-ended line segments with implementation-specific
  dimensions

  - `solid` single, straight, solid line

  - `double` two straight lines that add up to the size defined by `border-width`

  - `groove` border with a carved appearance; opposite of `ridge`

  - `ridge` border with an extruded appearance, opposite of `groove`

  - `inset` makes the element appear embedded; opposite of `outset`

  - `outset` makes the element appear embossed; opposite of `inset`

## Border

`border` is a shorthand for `border-width` `border-color` and `border-style`

## Border Radius

- `border-radius` rounds the corners of an element's outer border edge

- Values can be given in the following ways:

  - one value for all four corners

  - two values: first for the *top-left & bottom-right* and second for the
  *top-right & bottom-left*

  - three values for *top-left*, *top-right & bottom-left* and *bottom-right*

  - four values, one for each corner starting from *top-left* in clock-wise direction

- Values can be followed by a `/` and an additional value for elliptical corners
