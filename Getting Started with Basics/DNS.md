# Domain Name System

- The DNS is like a look-up table that links the `URLs` or websites to their server's
IP addresses

- When you types an address or click a link, your browser sends the domain name
to your **ISP**

- The **ISP** does a *domain name search* and returns the corresponding IP address

- Your browser connects to the server represented by this IP address

- This information is cached by your browser to reduce response time
