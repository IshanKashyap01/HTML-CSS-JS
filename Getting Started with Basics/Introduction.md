# Introduction to Frontend Development

- It's the process of designing **user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)**
of a website or web application

- UI what the user *sees and interacts* with on his screen while UX is how the
user *feels* when using the software

- A website displays *static* content that remains the same for every viewer

- A webapp displays *dynamic* content that varies based on user-specific data

- `HTML`, which stands for *Hyper Text Markup Language* is used to provide
structure to our frontend

- While `CSS`, which stands for *Cascading Style Sheets* is used to design or
beautify it

- Whereas, `Javascript` is used to code interactive features into the frontend
